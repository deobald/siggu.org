This idea is stolen from _Age of Empires_, an old PC strategy game. In _Age of
Empires_, players would build up their societies and at some point attempt to create
"wonders" like the pyramids of Egypt, massive churches, mosques, mausoleums, military
watchtowers, and towers of the we-just-built-this-to-see-how-big-we-could-make-it
sort.

As far as _Age of Empires II_ is concerned, there was also one observatory for the
purpose of astronomy... but largely the wonders were for religious or military
purposes:
