1. Silence

- sit cross-legged & upright
- close eyes

2. Recite your affirmations

- articulate & note how you want your life to look in every area
- clarify motives by asking **why** you want what you want

3. Visualize your perfect day

- visualize how you look and how you feel as you achieve your goals

4. Note down goals

5. Read some

- read books on personal development
- goal: 2-10 pages per day

- and write!

6. Exercise

- morning is better, too exhausted in evening
- e.g. push-ups, crunches, run, yoga, 7-min workout
- even if only 1 min, enough to get heart rate up, blood pumping, lungs filled with oxygen
